A subclass of hildondesktop.HomePluginItem to ease the creation of
Hildon-compliant desktop widgets in Python. It consolidates code to round
corners and render semi-transparently with a clean gradient look and highlight
when clicked.

Much of the code came from the conversations-inbox-widget (written in C) and
several other python widgets (which all appeared to be copy-pasting the same
boilerplate). It is provided in the hopes that people will stop copying and
pasting bad, half-working code and start reusing standard code.

Please consider improving it or filing a bug if it doesn't meet your needs yet
(which is currently very likely).
